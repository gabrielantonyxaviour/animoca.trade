## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Run full test suite
cd contracts && forge test
cd ../frontend && npm test

# Run E2E tests
./scripts/e2e-test.sh sepolia

# Check deployment readiness
./scripts/deploy-production.sh sepolia DRY_RUN=true
```

### 2. Deploy to Testnet (Sepolia)
```bash
# Deploy contracts
./scripts/deploy-production.sh sepolia

# Verify deployment
forge verify-contract --chain sepolia CONTRACT_ADDRESS

# Test on testnet
# Manual testing through UI
```

### 3. Deploy to Mainnet
```bash
# CAREFUL - Real money!
./scripts/deploy-production.sh mainnet

# Verify all contracts
# Update production configuration
# Monitor for 24-48 hours
```

### 4. Post-Deployment
- Transfer ownership to multisig
- Enable rate limiting
- Activate monitoring alerts
- Update public documentation
- Announce go-live

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **AIR Integration**: Simplified credential validation (needs real AIR integration)
2. **Oracle Security**: Basic implementation (needs signature verification)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented in contracts (add in production)
4. **Circuit Breakers**: No emergency pause functionality

### Recommended Improvements
1. Implement proper AIR credential verification
2. Add oracle signature verification
3. Implement rate limiting for minting
4. Add emergency pause functionality
5. Implement upgradeable proxy pattern
6. Add more comprehensive event indexing

## Security Recommendations

### Before Mainnet
1. **Professional Audit**: Get contracts audited
2. **Bug Bounty**: Set up bug bounty program
3. **Multisig Wallet**: Use for admin functions
4. **Monitoring**: Set up 24/7 monitoring
5. **Incident Response**: Prepare incident response plan

### Operational Security
1. Use hardware wallets for deployment
2. Never commit private keys
3. Rotate API keys regularly
4. Monitor for unusual activity
5. Keep dependencies updated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review all completed deliverables
2. Run complete test suite
3. Deploy to Sepolia testnet
4. Conduct UAT testing
5. Fix any identified issues

### Before Mainnet Launch
1. Security audit completion
2. Load testing at scale
3. Disaster recovery planning
4. Legal/compliance review
5. Marketing preparation

### Post-Launch
1. Monitor system health
2. Gather user feedback
3. Plan feature updates
4. Scale infrastructure
5. Community building
