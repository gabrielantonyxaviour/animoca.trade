# Token Economics & Mechanics - Fee-Based Revenue Model

## Core Economic Model

### Verification Fee Revenue System

#### Fee Collection Formula
```
Token Holder Revenue = (User's Token Share / Total Token Supply) × Total Verification Fees

Where:
- Verification Fees: USDC collected from credential minting, verification, high-value charges
- Token Share: Number of tokens held by user
- Total Supply: Total circulating token supply
- Distribution: Real-time or batched distributions
```

#### Verification Fee Structure
```
Credential Minting Fees (in USDC):
- Basic Credentials: $1-5 per mint
- Professional Certifications: $5-25 per mint
- Advanced/Expert Credentials: $25-100 per mint
- Rare/Unique Credentials: $100-500 per mint

On-Chain Verification Fees:
- Standard Verification: $0.50-2 per verification
- High-Value Verification: $2-10 per verification
- Enterprise Verification: $10-50 per verification

High-Value Credential Services:
- Background Check Integration: $25-100
- Certificate of Authenticity: $50-200
- Legal Documentation: $100-500
```

#### Revenue Distribution Mechanisms
```
Fee Pool Distribution:
- Token Holders: 80% of verification fees
- Platform Treasury: 15% of verification fees
- Development Fund: 5% of verification fees

Distribution Schedule:
- Real-time: Small fees (<$10) distributed immediately
- Batched: Larger fees batched daily for gas efficiency
- Minimum Claim: $1 USDC minimum to claim accumulated fees

Token Supply Management:
- Fixed Supply: No new token minting after initial creation
- Market-Driven: Supply determined by initial liquidity provision
- Buyback Program: Platform uses treasury to buyback tokens during high revenue periods
```

### AMM Pool Economics

#### Trading Fee Structure
```
Total Trading Fee: 0.30% per trade

Distribution:
- Liquidity Providers: 0.25% (83.3%)
- Protocol Treasury: 0.05% (16.7%)

Fee Calculation Example:
$1000 trade → $3.00 total fees
- LPs receive: $2.50
- Protocol receives: $0.50
```

#### Liquidity Provision Requirements

##### Initial Liquidity (Token Creation)
```
Minimum Requirements:
- Token Amount: 1,000 tokens minimum
- ETH Value: Equivalent to 1,000 tokens at $0.10 minimum ($100)
- Lock Period: 30 days (cannot withdraw)
- Gradual Release: 25% per week after lock-up expires

Example Launch:
Token Price Target: $0.50
- Provide: 2,000 tokens + 1 ETH ($2000)
- Creates pool with $1,000 tokens value + $1,000 ETH
- Initial price: $0.50 per token
```

##### Ongoing Liquidity Provision
```
Requirements:
- Minimum: $50 worth of each token
- Impermanent Loss Warning: Clearly disclosed
- Fee APR: Displayed dynamically based on volume

LP Token Mechanics:
- ERC-20 LP tokens representing pool share
- Proportional ownership of pool reserves
- Automatic fee compounding
- Transferable/tradeable LP positions
```

#### Price Discovery Mechanism
```
Constant Product Formula: x × y = k

Where:
- x = Token reserves in pool
- y = ETH reserves in pool
- k = Constant product

Price Calculation:
Price = ETH_reserves / Token_reserves

Example:
Pool has 1,000 tokens and 0.5 ETH
Price = 0.5 ETH / 1,000 tokens = 0.0005 ETH per token
```

### Reputation Scoring System

#### TWAP-Based Reputation Formula
```
Reputation Score = log₂(TWAP_30d) × Volume_Weight × Liquidity_Multiplier × Stability_Bonus

Components:
1. TWAP_30d: 30-day time-weighted average price
2. Volume_Weight: Based on trading activity (0.5x - 2.0x)
3. Liquidity_Multiplier: Pool depth bonus (1.0x - 1.5x)
4. Stability_Bonus: Low volatility reward (1.0x - 1.3x)
```

#### Volume Weight Calculation
```
24h Trading Volume Tiers:
- $0 - $100: 0.5x multiplier
- $100 - $500: 0.7x multiplier
- $500 - $1,000: 0.9x multiplier
- $1,000 - $5,000: 1.1x multiplier
- $5,000 - $10,000: 1.3x multiplier
- $10,000+: 1.5x multiplier

High Volume Bonus:
- Sustained high volume (7+ days): +0.2x
- Very high volume ($25,000+ daily): +0.5x
```

#### Liquidity Depth Multiplier
```
Total Pool Liquidity:
- $100 - $500: 1.0x (base)
- $500 - $1,000: 1.05x
- $1,000 - $5,000: 1.1x
- $5,000 - $10,000: 1.2x
- $10,000 - $25,000: 1.3x
- $25,000+: 1.5x

Deep Liquidity Bonus:
- $50,000+ pools: Additional +0.1x
- $100,000+ pools: Additional +0.2x
```

#### Stability Bonus System
```
Volatility Measurement (30-day):
- Standard deviation of daily price changes

Stability Tiers:
- Very High Volatility (>50% daily): 0.8x penalty
- High Volatility (25-50% daily): 0.9x penalty
- Medium Volatility (10-25% daily): 1.0x (neutral)
- Low Volatility (5-10% daily): 1.1x bonus
- Very Low Volatility (<5% daily): 1.2x bonus

Sustained Stability Bonus:
- 30+ days of low volatility: +0.1x
- 90+ days of low volatility: +0.2x
```

### Economic Incentive Alignment

#### Stakeholder Value Flows

##### Credential Holders
```
Revenue Streams:
1. Verification Fee Revenue: USDC from actual credential usage
2. Token Appreciation: Benefit from increased demand
3. Liquidity Provision: Optional USDC LP fees

Expected Returns (based on verification activity):
- Low activity credentials: $2-10/month in USDC
- Moderate activity credentials: $10-50/month in USDC
- High-demand credentials: $50-300/month in USDC

Risks:
- Low verification demand reduces revenue
- Credential revocation stops fee generation
- Market competition from similar credentials
```

##### Token Creators
```
Investment Requirements:
- Initial USDC liquidity: $100-$2,000 minimum
- Gas costs: $50-200 for deployment
- Time investment: Setup and promotion

Revenue Opportunities:
1. USDC verification fee revenue as token holder
2. Token appreciation if credential demand grows
3. First-mover advantage in credential category
4. Enhanced reputation value from market validation

Risks:
- Impermanent loss from USDC LP position
- Low verification activity/fee generation
- Market undervaluation of credential
```

##### Liquidity Providers
```
Revenue Model:
- USDC trading fees: 0.25% of all volume
- Potential credential token appreciation
- USDC fee collection (stable value)

Expected Returns:
- Low volume pools: 5-15% APR in USDC
- Medium volume pools: 15-30% APR in USDC
- High volume pools: 30-60% APR in USDC

Risks:
- Impermanent loss from token-USDC price divergence
- Smart contract risks
- Pool abandonment risk
```

##### Traders/Speculators
```
Opportunities:
1. Credential reputation speculation
2. Arbitrage between pools
3. Market inefficiency exploitation
4. Portfolio diversification across credential types

Strategies:
- Long-term: Hold tokens of growing reputation credentials
- Short-term: Trade on news/events affecting credential value
- Arbitrage: Price differences across markets
- Portfolio: Diversified credential exposure

Risks:
- High volatility and potential losses
- Limited liquidity in some pools
- Regulatory uncertainty
```

+ Utility features development
+ Cross-platform integrations

Balancing Mechanisms:
- Emission decay over time
- Fee burning reduces supply
- Natural market price discovery
```

```

#### Long-term Economic Sustainability

##### Network Effects
```
Growth Flywheel:
1. More credentials → More tokens → More trading
2. More trading → Higher fees → Better liquidity
3. Better liquidity → More traders → Higher prices
4. Higher prices → More credential value → More participants

Critical Mass Targets:
- 100+ active tokens for initial market
- 1,000+ tokens for sustainable ecosystem
- 10,000+ tokens for mature market
```

##### Revenue Projections
```
Conservative Scenario (Year 1):
- 500 tokens created × $25 avg creation fee = $12,500
- $500K monthly volume × 0.05% × 12 months = $3,000
- Total: $15,500 annual revenue

Moderate Scenario (Year 2):
- 2,000 tokens × $25 = $50,000
- $2M monthly volume × 0.05% × 12 = $12,000
- Total: $62,000 annual revenue

Optimistic Scenario (Year 3):
- 5,000 tokens × $25 = $125,000
- $10M monthly volume × 0.05% × 12 = $60,000
- Total: $185,000 annual revenue
```

This economic model creates sustainable incentives for all participants while maintaining healthy market dynamics and preventing manipulation or exploitation of the system.
